The homepage is broken up the way you might traditionally browse a DMO’s website,
with sections like “Tours” “Archaeological sites” and “cities.” But rather than reading long lists, you’re scrolling through gorgeous photos that are the motivation to learn 
more about old civilizations & their great history .
